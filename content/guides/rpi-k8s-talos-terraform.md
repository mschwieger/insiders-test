This repo is a fully working example of deploying a Kubernetes cluster to a handful of Raspberry Pi 4s. We use [Talos](https://talos.dev)
for the OS and building the Kubernetes cluster. After the cluster is bootstraped, we use Terraform deploy various useful services onto the cluster.

## Features

At the end of this tutorial you'll have a fully working Kubernetes cluster with the following services configured and ready to use:

* [Talos](https://talos.dev) - Minimal and hardened operating system and tools that deploy and manage kubernetes nodes/clusters.
  * Virtual (shared) IP address for the talos and Kubernetes endpoints
* [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf) - Load balancers using virtual/shared IPs
* [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) - Provide metrics for Kubernetes autoscaling (e.g. horizontal pod autoscaler)
* [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - Automated TLS certificate management
* [Rook-Ceph](https://rook.io/) - Distributed block, object and file storage
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - Monitoring and alerting
  * Full monitoring of your cluster! We gather metrics from just about every service that has them.
* [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) - Log aggregation
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) - Visualize and explore metrics, logs and other data.
  * Since we use the [kube-prometheus-stack
](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) helm chart a bunch of dashboards are pre-generated for you. We also automatically deploy dashboards for monitoring rook-ceph.
* [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) - Send Prometheus alerts to email, PagerDuty, etc.
* [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) - Suggest or automatically adjust resource limits and requests for pods.
