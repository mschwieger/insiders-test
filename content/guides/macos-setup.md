# macOS Setup

Originally I wrote this guide to remind myself how to setup my M1 Macbook the way I like it. A few friends and coworkers expressed interest in my setup, so I cleaned up the notes (a bit) and created this guide. You don't need to follow this guide completely, I encourage you to pick-and-choose the pieces you want to use and to tweak things to fit your needs. I also love to see how other people have setup their systems, so please share your configs!

## Recommended Software

Download and install these following the instructions on their websites:

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)

To easily format help output from a command, I put the following alias and function in my `~/.zshrc` file:

```shell
# ~/.zshrc
alias bathelp='bat --plain --language=help'
help() {
    "$@" --help 2>&1 | bathelp
}
