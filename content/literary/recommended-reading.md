# Recommended Reading

These are some of the books I recommend reading. I prefer buying physical books from indepenant/local book stores and from online retailers/publishers that offer DRM-free ebooks. If you have to ask Amazon before you open a book, you don't own that book, Amazon does.

[No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com) is great, when you purchase a printed book you get a DRM-free ebook as well. These are always in PDF format but sometimes also in Mobi and ePub too. They also offer "early access" to chapters of books you've pre-ordered.

This list is always growing, and it's nowhere complete, so check back from time to time for more.

## Manga Guides

The "Manga Guide" series is a great way to learn about various topics from databases to physics. You can find them all on [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/catalog/manga). If you are a developer and work with any kind of relational database, I strongly recommend getting [The Manga Guide to Databases](https://nostarch.com/mg_databases.htm), especially if you have never heard of normalization.
